M: All right welcome to the Deep dive today we're diving into the fascinating world of prompt engineering you know that Art of Getting large language models to do exactly what you want them to do.

W: And it really is an art isn't it I mean anyone can write a prompt right but to really make those llms sing especially for our kaggle folks out there dealing with code and complex data well that's where the real skill comes in.

M: Absolutely so if you're a kagler you're trying to generate killer code squash those pesky bugs and come up with innovative solutions well that's what we're focusing on today we've got a fantastic white paper here that we're going to dissect pulling out the most practical and Powerful techniques you can use to level up your kaggle game. Our mission is clear to equip you with the prompt engineering methodologies you need to succeed we'll cover the basics but then we're going to go deep exploring techniques like Chain of Thought and react and we're going to do it all through the lens of your everyday kaggle challenges so this isn't just Theory it's about giving you tools you can immediately put to work in your competitions.

W: Perfect now before we even start crafting those awesome prompts we need to talk about something fundamental.

M: Yeah configuring the lm's output is not just what you put in it's how you shape what comes out right and you have a surprising amount of control here let's start with output length which might seem simple but the number of tokens the model generates directly impacts costs processing time those are real world concerns especially in a kaggle notebook.

W: Yeah if you're hitting those kaggle output limits or need an answer quickly just setting a low token limit in the model configuration might not cut it.

M: Exactly sometimes you need to engineer your prompt to be more targeted to get a concise response like in the react technique where you're aiming for quick iterative actions.

W: Makes sense okay let's move on to sampling controls now this is where things get really interesting we're talking about how the llm actually chooses the next word based on probabilities.

M: You got it and how we sample from those probabilities can dramatically change what we get back.

W: Okay so let's break it down what's this temperature thing all about.

M: Think of temperature like a dial that controls Randomness a low temperature pushes the model towards the most likely words so you get predictable deterministic output it's almost like getting the model's best guess.

W: So if I need to generate some very specific code from my kaggle kernel like importing a library with the correct syntax a low temperature is probably what I want.

M: Exactly you don't want the llm getting too creative with your import Panda statement.

W: No definitely not but sometimes a bit of creativity is exactly what you need in kaggle.

M: Absolutely that's where a higher temperature comes in it introduces more Randomness so you get more diverse and unexpected results you might use this to brainstorm novel features or explore different algorithms those what if moments that can spark a breakthrough in your kaggle project.

W: That's really cool so low temp for precision of my code higher temp for exploring new ideas got it now what about top K and top P these sound like ways to further fine-tune that word selection process.

M: They are both top K and top P also known as nucleus sampling limit the next word to only the most probable candidates with top K you're essentially saying only consider the top K most likely options.

W: Okay so a higher K means more variety in the output while a lower K makes it more focused and if K is one it's basically that deterministic best guess again right.

M: Yeah precisely with top P you're working with probabilities instead of a fixed number it selects the smallest set of words whose probabilities add up to at least the value of P so a lower P makes the output more restrictive while a higher P closer to one considers almost all possible words.

W: And just like with top k a p of zero is essentially forcing that best gas.

M: Exactly the key for your kaggle work is to experiment with these sometimes one works better than the other and sometimes a combination is the sweet spot.

W: So how do all these settings work together if I just temperature top K and top P what happens in what order.

M: Great question when all three are in play the model first looks for words that meet both the top K and top P criteria then the temperature setting comes in to randomly pick from that filtered set based on their probabilities.

W: So it filters by top K and top P first and then the temperature setting influences the final Choice among those filtered words.

M: Yeah what if only top K or top p is set then it just filters by whichever one is active and if temperature isn't set a word is just randomly chosen from those that pass the filter.

W: Interesting so if I really need that super deterministic code generation for my kaggle notebook I should Crank That temperature down to zero.

M: You got it a temperature of zero essentially eliminates the randomness and forces the model to always pick the most probable word in that case the top K and top P settings become less relevant.

W: Makes sense and on the flip side setting top K to one or top P to zero also forces that single best guess overriding the temperature setting.

M: Absolutely and very high values for k or a p of one essentially let almost all possible words into the mix.

W: Okay so with all these dials to play with where do we even start any recommendations for our Cagle folks.

M: The paper actually offers some excellent starting points for generally coherent results with a touch of creativity maybe when you're brainstorming model architectures for your competition they suggest a temperature around2 a top P of 0.95 and a top K of 30 those are good benchmarks to keep in mind.

W: What if I'm really pushing for Creative output like trying to come up with completely new data augmentation techniques.

M: Then you might bump those up a bit try a temperature of 0.9 top P of 099 and top K of 40 that'll give you more variety and potentially lead to some truly outof the-box ideas.

W: Awesome and what about when I need less creativity and more factual accuracy like when I'm generating that boiler plate code for a common kaggle task.

M: For that dial things back down try a lower temperature maybe 0.1 top P of 0.9 and top gave 20.

W: Perfect and what if I just need a single correct answer like implementing a specific algorithm in my kernel.

M: In those cases a temperature of zero is usually your best bet.

W: Got it now the paper also mentioned something called the repetition Loop bug what is that.

M: Ah the repetition Loop bug it's a real headache where the model gets stuck repeating the same words or phrases over and over again.

W: Sounds frustrating how does that even happen.

M: It can actually happen at both low and high temperatures at low temperatures the model can get too predictable and get stuck in a loop revisiting the same words and at high temperatures all that Randomness can by chance lead back to a previous state creating a loop.

W: So it's like the model is either too predictable or too random and either way it ends up repeating itself.

M: Precisely the key is to really fine-tune those sampling parameters temperature top K and top P to find that sweet spot where you get creative and interesting output without falling into those repetitive traps.

W: Okay so we've got a good handle on how to configure the llms output to get the kind of responses we need for our kaggle work now let's Dive Into the Heart of prompt engineering the actual techniques themselves.

M: Let's do it and the paper really stresses that crafting clear prompts is the foundation of getting great predictions from these models using specific techniques can further boost those results. So where do we start.

W: The simplest form is what's called General prompting or zero shot prompting you're basically giving the model A task description and some input without any examples.

M: So if I'm working on a kaggle problem and need a code snippet to do some data pre-processing I could just describe the task and provide the relevant data and the model should be able to generate the code.

W: That's the idea the model has seen a massive amount of code so it should have a decent shot at understanding your request.

M: Makes sense but the paper also emphasizes something really important documenting your prompts right.

W: This is crucial especially for kaggle where you're constantly it in and trying to improve your Solutions you'll experiment with different prompts and keeping track of what worked what didn't and why is essential for learning and getting better.

M: So a structured approach to documenting prompts is key what if zero shot prompting isn't quite cutting it maybe I need more control over the output format or need the model to generate something more specific.

W: Then you move on to one shot and few shot prompting here you provide examples within the prompt to guide the model.

M: So if I need the output in a specific Json format for my kaggle submission I'd show the model a few examples of the input data and the corresponding Json output I expect.

W: Exactly the model learns from those examples and gets a much clearer understanding of the task and the desired output format.

M: This seems incredibly useful for kaggle especially for tasks like extracting specific information from data or formatting your model predictions but the paper also cautions about the examples themselves.

W: Yes the quality and relevance of your examples are crucial if you use poorly chosen examples or if there's even a small error in one it can confuse the model and lead to garbage output.

M: So garbage in garbage out as they say and it's especially important to include examples of edge cases those unusual situations that your code or model might encounter in the competition.

W: Absolutely if you want your solutions to be robust and handle those unexpected scenarios your examples need to reflect that.

M: Okay so we've covered zot one shot and few shot prompting now the paper moves into system contextual androll prompting these sound like different ways to provide more highle guidance to the llm which could be really powerful in kaggle.

W: They are and while they can overlap each focuses on a slightly different aspect system prompting is all about setting the overall context and purpose it's like defining the big picture for the model.

M: So I might use a system prompt to tell the model you are a helpful and efficient coding assistant for a catle data scientist.

W: Exactly or you could use it to specify output requirements like output all predictions as a Json object with specific keys.

M: That Json example is really relevant for kaggle having structured data in a predictable format is crucial for further analysis and creating those submission files.

W: Absolutely the paper even notes that using system prompts to enforce Json output can help limit errors and ensure the data comes back in a usable order.

M: Interesting now what about role prompting.

W: With role prompting you're giving the llm a specific Persona or identity this can really influence the style and tone of its responses.

M: So if I'm working on a kaggle project that involves generating documentation I could prompt the model to act as a senior software engineer or a technical writer to get more tailored and effective documentation.

W: Precisely it's about giving the model a clear understanding of the perspective you need it to take you can even get creative with it maybe you want a humorous but technically accurate style when explaining your code or a more formal and rigorous style for your competition write up.

M: That's really cool now contextual prom seems to be more about providing specific background information that's relevant to the task at hand right.

W: It's about giving the model all the details it needs to understand the nuances of your specific kaggle problem.

M: So if I'm asking the llm for help debugging my code I wouldn't just say my code's not working I'd provide the specific code snippet the error message and the libraries I'm using.

W: Exactly the more context you provide the more relevant and helpful the model's response is likely to be this is really starting to feel like a powerful toolkit for tackling kaggle challenges. Now the paper introduces stepback prompting what's that all about.

M: Stepback prompting is a clever technique where you first ask the llm to answer a broader related question before getting to your specific task it's like priming the pump getting the model to activate its knowledge base before diving into the details of your kaggle problem.

W: So if I'm trying to come up with a novel feature for my competition I might first ask the llm about general principles of feature engineering before prompting it for specific ideas related to my data set.

M: That's the idea it can lead to more insightful and creative outputs and the paper even suggests it can help mitigate biases in the lm's responses. Now we get to a technique that's been getting a lot of attention Chain of Thought prompting it seems particularly relevant for those multi-step reasoning problems we often encounter in kaggle.

W: It is cot is a powerful technique for boosting the model's reasoning capabilities the idea is to prompt the model to explicitly gener intermediate reasoning steps before giving the final answer or code suggestion.

M: So instead of just getting a solution I also get to see the models thought process how it arrived at that solution that could be incredibly valuable for understanding the llm suggestions and making sure they're actually sound.

W: Absolutely the paper highlights several advantages of cotti it's easy to implement it works well with readily available llms it makes the reasoning process transparent and it seems to improve the robustness of the reasoning across different l conversions.

M: But there's a trade-off right it uses more tokens which could mean higher cost and processing time in a kaggle environment.

W: That's true since the model is generating those intermediate steps the output will be longer the paper shows a great example of coat using a math problem a direct prompt gets the wrong answer but when prompted to think step by step the model gets it right.

M: That's a compelling example and the paper also shows how combining coat with a single example can further improve the results right they call that single shot coat too. So codee seems incredibly valuable for those kaggle tasks that involve complex logical reasoning like debugging intricate code or figuring out why my model's performance is stuck.

W: Definitely and the paper even suggests its applicability to code generation and creating synthetic data now building on that idea of getting more reliable answers from the model there's also self-consistency what's that about.

M: Self-consistency takes code a step further you get the model to generate multiple different reasoning paths for the same prompt and then you choose the most consistent answer across those paths.

W: So it's like getting multiple expert opinions from the model and then going with a consensus that makes a lot of sense for improving reliability especially for those crucial kaggle submissions.

M: Exactly it can be a bit more computationally intensive but for high stakes tasks it can be a worthwhile tradeoff Now we move on to a technique with a very intriguing name tree of thoughts 2T the name itself suggests a more complex and branching approach to problem solving which seems perfect for those really open-ended kaggle challenges.

W: It is tree of thoughts is a generalization of CTI where the llm explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously rather than just a single linear chain of thoughts it's like the model is branching out exploring different Avenues and backtracking if needed just like we do when we're tackling a tough problem.

M: So for those really challenging kaggle problems where there isn't one clear solution path 2T might be the way to go.

W: Absolutely and if you look at the figure and the paper that contrasts K and 2T you can really see how 2T allows for much more exploration and creative problem solving.

M: Okay we're nearing the end of our prompt engineering journey and we arrive at a technique called react reason and act this one seems particularly exciting for kagglers who want to use llms to interact with external tools and data sources.

W: You got it react stands for reason and act and it's all about combining the lm's reasoning capabilities with the ability to use external tools like search engines code interpreters or even apis.

M: So the llm could actually execute code in my kaggle notebook analyze the results and then use that information to guide its next steps that's incredibly powerful.

W: It is it's like the llm is becoming an active participant in your kagle workflow not just a passive code generator the paper shows an example using Lang chain and vertex AI where the model uses search to find information and then uses that information to make decisions.

M: And then we have automatic prompt engineering AP the idea of an AI writing props for itself is pretty mind-blowing.

W: It is AP is a technique for automating the creation of effective prompts you essentially ask the model to generate various prompt variations for a task and then you evaluate those variations based on their performance.

M: So I could use this to automatically find better prompts for code generation or data analysis in my kaggle project.

W: Exactly it could save you a lot of manual experimentation and potentially uncover prompts that you wouldn't have thought of on your own now the paper also dedicates a whole section to code prompting which is obviously a huge area of interest for kagglers.

M: Absolutely prompt engineering isn't just for natural language tasks it's incredibly useful for anything code related so let's break it down what are some of the key applications of code prompting in kaggle.

W: Well they start with prompts for writing code they show an example of prompting for a bash script the key takeaway here is that llms can really speed up your code development but always review and test the generated code carefully before relying on it.

M: That's crucial advice don't just blindly trust the model's output especially when it comes to code that could mess up your kaggle environment right.

W: Then there's prompts for explaining code they take that bash script and ask the model to explain what it does which it does quite well this can be super helpful for understanding unfamiliar code or collaborating with teammates and kaggle.

M: Definitely it's like having an instant code explainer on hand what about translating code that could be really useful if I find a cool algorithm in a language I'm not so familiar with.

W: Absolutely they show an example of Translating that bash script into python again it's important to double check the translated code and make sure it works as expected.

M: And last but not least prompts for debugging and reviewing code this is something every kagler has struggled with at some point.

W: For sure they give an example of a broken python script and show how prompting the llm with the error Trace back can lead to it identifying the error and suggesting a fix and even cooler it can some sometimes suggest ways to make your code more robust and efficient.

M: That's amazing it's like having a codic buddy who's always there to help you debug and proove your code.

W: It really is and the paper also briefly touches on multimodal prompting.

M: Ah yes using inputs Beyond just text like images or audio that's a whole other level of prompt engineering.

W: It is and it's still an evolving area it could become increasingly relevant for kaggle competitions that involve multimodal data sets.

M: Okay we've covered a ton of prompt engineering techniqu teques and it's clear they have huge potential in kaggle but to really Master this we need to talk about best practices.

W: Absolutely the paper lays out some fantastic best practices that can really elevate your prompt engineering game and the first one is so simple but so important provide examples one shot and few shot prompting we've talked about it and it's a powerful way to teach the model what you want.

M: Right and the next best practice is to design with Simplicity keep your prompts clear concise and easy to understand both for you and for the LL so get straight to the point with your coding requests avoid jargon and use strong action verbs to tell the model exactly what you wanted to do.

W: Exactly and remember to be specific about the desired output if you need your predictions in a particular CSV format tell the llm don't leave it guessing.

M: And this one's interesting use instructions over constraints so in kaggle instead of saying don't use this Library I might say write code that only uses these specific libraries.

W: That's a great example focusing on positive instructions can often be more effective than relying on constraints and speaking of practicalities remember to control the max token length to stay within those kaggle limits and manage processing time.

M: Right and to make our kagle prompt libraries more reusable and maintainable we should use variables and prompts.

W: Absolutely this allows you to create Dynamic prompts that you can easily adapt for different data sets models or tasks without having to rewrite the entire prompt each time.

M: And of course experimentation is crucial in kaggle so we should experiment with input formats and writing styles.

W: Definitely try phrasing your prompts in different ways as questions statements instructions and see what works best for each specific task.

M: And if you're using F shop prompting for classification tasks in kaggle mix up the classes in your examples to prevent the model from getting biased.

W: Great tips and given how quickly AI is evolving we need to adapt to model updates new models and features are constantly being released and staying ahead of the Curve can give you a real Edge in kaggle.

M: Totally agree keep an eye out for updates and experiment to see how you can leverage new capabilities in your projects.

W: And speaking of experimentation we should also experiment with output formats for kaggle structured formats like CSV or Json are often the way to go especially for those data heavy tasks in kaggle using a structured format can make your life so much easier.

M: And if the llm doesn't quite get the Json format right there's even a section on Json repair using Library that can automatically fix those errors.

W: That's a real Lifesaver and if you're working with structured data in kaggle you might want to explore working with schemas to define the expected format of your data for the llm.

M: Using a Json schema can really help the model understand your data and reduce those frustrating misinterpretations collaboration is huge in kaggle and the paper encourages us to experiment together with other prompt Engineers bouncing ideas off each other and sharing successful prompt Str strategies can really accelerate your learning and lead to breakthroughs.

W: And for those using Sagle there are specific cut best practices to keep in mind like putting the final answer after the reasoning steps and setting the temperature to zero for those logical tasks.

M: Exactly and finally perhaps the most crucial best practice of all document the various prompt attempts keep detailed records of everything you try the results you get and your feedback on each prompt.

W: This is so important it allows you to track your progress understand what works best and debug issues in the future and if you're using a platform like vertex AI Studio saving and linking your prompts can save you a ton of time.

M: And if you're integrating prompts into your code the paper gives specific advice on how to manage and test those prompts effectively within your code base it all comes back to the fact that prompt engineering is an iterative process you're constantly learning and refining your approach to get the best possible results.

W: Exactly it's a journey not a destination.

M: Well we've covered a massive amount of ground today exploring a wide range of prompt engineering techniques and best practices all through the lens of kaggle we started with the basics of zero shot one shot and few shot prompting then moved on to techniques for providing context and guidance like system role and contextual prompting we explored those Advanced reasoning techniques stepb prompting Chain of Thought self-consistency tree of thoughts and even touched on react and automatic prompt engineering. And we dive deep into the world of code prompting with all its exciting possibilities and crucial considerations for kagglers. And of course we can't forget those invaluable best practices that can really make or break your prompt engineering efforts in kaggle.

W: It's clear that poorly crafted prompts can hold you back even with these incredibly powerful llms but mastering these techniques and best practices can give you a real advantage in the competitive world of kaggle.

M: So to all our kaggle listeners out there especially those working on those final Capstone projects or tackling those tough competition i s take these techniques and best practices and run with them experiment iterate and push the boundaries of what you can achieve with llms. And as we wrap up think about this pumped engineering is a rapidly evolving field it's changing how we interact with AI especially in technical domains like kagle.

W: What exciting new possibilities will emerge as these models become even more capable and we get even better at guiding them food for thought thanks for joining us on the Deep dive.

M: It's been a pleasure.
